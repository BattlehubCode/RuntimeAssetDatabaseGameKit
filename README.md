# RuntimeAssetDatabaseGameKit

This is the project I used to create a demo video for the [Runtime Asset Database](https://github.com/Battlehub0x/RuntimeAssetDatabase)

You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXWriLgrWdE)

The repository is based on the [Unity 3D Game Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/unity-learn-3d-game-kit-115747)

**Note: this repository use Git LFS, look up how to install git lfs for your computer before cloning the repository or you won't get the large files**
